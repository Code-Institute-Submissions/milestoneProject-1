* On medium and large screens all navigation menu content is displayed, and the rest of the content as well. Everything is adapted accordingto the screen size.
* All external links contain `target=_blank` so the users will navigate on separate pages.

* `carousel` photos did not work - FIXED
* `video` section did not displayed on smaller devices - FIXED
